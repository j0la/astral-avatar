**Substitution** is a VR locomotion technique built for the Oculus Quest with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

Both the left and right controller are equipped with direct movement and turning via [Godot XR Tools](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/xr/introducing_xr_tools.html). Additionally, the left controller can activate flight mode with the X button or teleport with the trigger.

`substitution.tscn` provides the avatar substitution mechanic. Substitution provides teleportation with rapid transition (the player interpolates to the new position). Pressing the button configured in the inspector spawns an avatar at the player's position. Pressing the button a second time interpolates the player towards the avatar. A `button_pressed` signal from the desired controller should be connected to `_on_button_pressed`. This mechanic is implemented as a custom XR Tools movement provider.

`mini.tscn` complements Substitution by shrinking the environment when the player spawns an avatar. After scaling down, the mini world is attached to one controller and can be manipulated by the other. The mini world provides greater avatar manipulation capability (like moving long distances or through walls). The world tree to minify, scale of the mini world, and controllers used for holding/manipulation are configurable in the inspector. The `avatar_spawn` and `start_sub` signals from `substitution.gd` should be connected to `mini.gd`'s `scale_down` and `scale_up` functions, respectively.

Together, Substitution and Mini provide a unique mechanism for traversing 3D environments.
